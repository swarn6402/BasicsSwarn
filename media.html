    <!-- The difference between the <video> / <audio> tags and <iframe> is that with <video> / <audio>, you embed media files that are hosted on the same server or directory as your website (or from a specified external source), whereas <iframe> is typically used to embed external content like videos from YouTube or other websites. It's not necessary for the media files to be in the same directory, but having them on the same server can improve loading times. -->
